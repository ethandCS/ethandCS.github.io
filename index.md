### CPSC 120

LAB 3

Lab 3, part 3 really stuck with me because it was the first introduction of the HilO game through my 120 lab. I really enjoyed making it what it is today throughout our labs. Optimizing and making our code more efficient.

LAB 5

Lab 5, part 2 was the first time I understood loops in practice. This being a big moment in my coding adventure I always thought back to this code or looked back to it when I needed clarification. Loops would always come after this.

LAB 6

Lab 6, part 1 not only was one of my favorites due to meeting a new friend as my partner; but it was the first time I understood loops' ability to go “down” in rows or across in columns. This also aided me with 2D vectors.
